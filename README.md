## 📦 Plugin Details

### DEV-ESSENTIALS Plugin (Core)

**Why install:** Provides fundamental development utilities including git workflow patterns, lateral thinking for breaking through blocks, expert consultation, code review, verification, backend TRS documentation, 8 quality hooks, and planning agents.

**Skills:**
- **git-workflow** - Branching strategies, conventional commits, PR workflow, merge vs rebase, conflict resolution, release management
- **lateral-thinking** - 5 thinking personas (Contrarian, Hacker, Simplifier, Researcher, Architect) that diagnose stagnation patterns and reframe problems
- **consult-experts** - Access specialized expert personas (Product Manager, Tech Lead, System Design Specialist, Code Reviewer) with a shared Release / Phase / Task nomenclature: PRDs now ship with release plans (v0.1.0 MVP, v0.2.0, …) and deferred features; TRDs break work into Development Phases tagged to PRD releases

**Agents:**
- **documentation-architect** - Create comprehensive, developer-focused documentation with context gathering and Maps of Content (MOC) navigation
- **plan-reviewer** - Review development plans before implementation
- **refactor-planner** - Create comprehensive refactoring strategies with brownfield-aware convention detection

**Commands:**
- **/dev-docs-update** - Update dev documentation before context compaction for seamless continuation
- **/dev-docs-be** - Generate a per-phase Technical Requirement Specification (TRS) by picking ONE phase from the TRD and producing a flat task list for that phase
- **/code-review** - Run security and quality review of uncommitted changes before committing
- **/verify** - Run comprehensive verification (build, types, lint, tests, secrets, debug statements)

**Hooks (8):** Pre-commit security scan, commit quality validation, block --no-verify, suggest compact, large file blocker, doc file warning, console.log warning, test file reminder

### essentials Plugin (Skills, Wiki, Chief-of-Staff, Scaffolding & Research)

**Why install:** Provides skill development tools, wiki maintenance with a full knowledge pipeline, chief-of-staff second-brain orchestrator, project scaffolding from language templates, and web research capabilities.

**Skills:**
- **skill-developer** - Meta-skill for creating and managing Claude Code skills
- **maintaining-wiki** - 7 operations for managing a personal knowledge base under `docs/02_learning/`: ingest, query, lint, status, reduce (extract atomic claims), reflect (discover connections), reweave (propagate new knowledge backward). Obsidian-compatible output.
- **deep-research** - Structured multi-round investigation pipeline: plan (task ledger, slug derivation) -> scale decision (complexity-based parallelism) -> execute (parallel searches) -> synthesize -> verify (citation anchoring, URL validation) -> deliver (source-grounded brief). 4 resource guides.
- **chief-of-staff** - Repo-native second-brain orchestrator with four operations (`cos daily`, `cos weekly`, `cos review`, `cos update`). Reads inbox, tasks, journal, and project folders; writes only to `docs/00_ops/meta/`; delegates wiki ops to `maintaining-wiki`. Draft-only cross-repo routing via `gh issue create`.
- **scaffold-project** - Bootstrap a new repo from one of the maintained templates (`python-scaffolding`, `go-scaffolding`, `react-scaffolding`). Drafts `gh repo create --template --clone` commands; user executes. Inspects the cloned template's `docs/` layout before drafting `cp` destinations, proposes a sanitization pass on vault docs copied into the new repo, and drafts a vault `CLAUDE.md` sibling-repos row so CoS tracks the new repo. Web-UI fallback when `gh` is unavailable.

> **Note:** The consult-experts skill has moved to the DEV-ESSENTIALS plugin. The chief-of-staff skill previously lived in its own plugin; it was folded into essentials in v2.4.0.

**Agents:**
- **business-strategist** - Create in-depth operational business plans from product ideas via interactive inquiry, synthesis, and formal plan generation
- **web-research-specialist** - Research technical issues and solutions online
