description: Create a comprehensive strategic plan with structured task breakdown
argument-hint: Describe what you need planned (e.g., "refactor authentication system", "implement microservices")

You are an elite backend specialist who creates comprehensive, technical requirement specification.
Create TRS for Feature: $ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

1. **Analyze the request** and determine the scope of planning needed
2. **Examine relevant files** as mentioned in user input - `/docs/2_architecture/TRD.md`, `/docs/1_product/PRD.md`
3. **Ask user for clarification** if any information is missing and required rather than making an assumption. Give options to the user along with small comparison of the different appraoches that can applied.
4. **Create a structured plan**  below sections:
    - **Overview & Scope**
    - **Requirements Summary**
    - **Detailed Component Design** (Classes/Modules Structure, Method Signatures, Data Structures)
    - **API Specifications (**Detailed endpoint definitions, request/response schemas, error handling, authentication requirements, and rate limiting considerations**)**
    - **Database Design** (Schema Details: Table structures, relationships, indexes, constraints | Data Access Patterns: How data will be queried, updated, and optimized | Migration Strategy: How schema changes will be applied)
    - **Algorithm & Logic Design** (Include pseudocode for complex operations)
    - **Error Handling & Edge Cases** (How the component handles failures, invalid inputs, timeout scenarios, and other edge cases. Include retry strategies and fallback mechanisms)
    - **Dependencies & Interfaces**
    - **Security Considerations** (Input validation, authorization checks, data sanitization, and security patterns specific to this component)
    - **Testing Strategy** (Unit test approach, test data requirements, mocking strategies, and coverage expectations for this specific component)
    - **Performance Considerations** (Expected load patterns, optimization strategies, caching approaches, and performance monitoring for this component)
    - **Implementation Phases**: Break down into logical phases with:

        **Phase N:** [Phase Name]

        **Objective:** [Clear goal]

        **Tasks:**
        * **[Task Name]** [Effort: S/M/L/XL]
          - **Description**: What needs to be done
          - **Acceptance Criteria**:
              - [ ]  Specific, testable criterion 1
              - [ ]  Specific, testable criterion 2
          - **Files to Create/Modify**:
              - `path/to/file.py` - Purpose
          - **Dependencies**: Task #X, Task #Y
          - **Testing Requirements**: Unit/Integration/E2E
        * [Additional tasks...]

        **Phase Deliverables:**
        - Working feature/component
        - Tests passing
        - Documentation updated
    - **Pending Decisions & Clarifications** (List any items identified during the process that still require decisions or further input from user side. Give user options about the decisions)
5. **Create task management structure**:
   - Create directory: `dev/active/[task-name]/` (relative to project root)
   - Generate three files:
     - `[task-name]-plan.md` - The comprehensive plan
     - `[task-name]-context.md` - Key files, made and pending decisions, dependencies, integration points
     - `[task-name]-tasks.md` - Checklist format for tracking progress

## Quality Standards
- Plans must be self-contained with all necessary context
- Use clear, actionable language
- Include specific technical details where relevant
- Consider both technical and business perspectives

## **Common Pitfall to Avoid**
- **Don't skip clarifying questions** - Assumptions can lead to rework so, **Do take time to ask calrifying questions** - Clarity upfront saves time later
