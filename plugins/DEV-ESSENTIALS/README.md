## Installation

```bash
# From your project directory
/plugin install DEV-ESSENTIALS@ai-workx
```

## Usage Examples

### Using Skills

**Git Workflow:**
```bash
"Help me set up a branching strategy for my project"
"What's the conventional commit format?"
"How should I resolve this merge conflict?"
"Create a PR description for my changes"
```

**Lateral Thinking (when stuck):**
```bash
"I'm stuck on this caching problem, nothing I try works"
"I keep going in circles on this auth flow"
"I need a different perspective on this architecture"
"Help me think about this from the contrarian angle"
```

**Consult Experts:**
```bash
"Consult product expert for help with my roadmap"
"Get tech lead advice on my system architecture"
"I need a code review from the expert reviewer"
"Consult system design expert for my distributed system"
```

### Using Agents Directly

**Documentation:**
```bash
"Use the documentation-architect agent to document my new billing service"
```

**Plan Review:**
```bash
"Use the plan-reviewer agent to review my authentication implementation plan"
```

**Refactoring:**
```bash
"Use the refactor-planner agent to plan breaking down this large service"
```

### Using Commands

**Code Review (before committing):**
```bash
/code-review
```
Reviews uncommitted changes for security vulnerabilities, code quality issues, and best practice violations. Produces a severity report with verdict (Approve/Warning/Block).

**Verification (before PRs):**
```bash
/verify              # Full check (default)
/verify quick        # Build + types only
/verify pre-commit   # Build + types + lint + secrets
/verify pre-pr       # Full + security scan
```

**Backend TRS Documentation:**
```bash
/dev-docs-be refactor authentication system
/dev-docs-be implement order processing microservice
```
Creates comprehensive Technical Requirement Specifications with implementation phases, database design, API specs, and task breakdown.

**Update Documentation:**
```bash
/dev-docs-update
/dev-docs-update authentication system changes and new middleware
```

## Hooks

Hooks are event-driven automations that fire before or after Claude Code tool executions. They enforce code quality, catch mistakes early, and automate repetitive checks.

### How Hooks Work

```
User request -> Claude picks a tool -> PreToolUse hook runs -> Tool executes -> PostToolUse hook runs
```

- **PreToolUse** hooks run before tool execution. They can **block** (exit code 2) or **warn** (stderr).
- **PostToolUse** hooks run after tool completion. They can analyze output but cannot block.

### PreToolUse Hooks

| Hook | Matcher | What it does | Exit code |
|------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| block-no-verify | Bash | Blocks `git commit --no-verify` | 2 (block) |
| pre-commit-security | Bash | Scans staged files for secrets (sk-, ghp_, AKIA, api_key, password) | 2 (block) |
| commit-quality | Bash | Validates commit format, detects debugger/console.log in staged files | 0 (warn) or 2 (block) |
| suggest-compact | Edit, Write | Suggests `/compact` every ~50 tool calls | 0 (warn) |
| large-file-blocker | Write | Blocks files exceeding 800 lines | 2 (block) |
| doc-file-warning | Write | Warns about non-standard doc files | 0 (warn) |

### PostToolUse Hooks

| Hook | Matcher | What it does |
|------|---------|-------------|
| console-log-warning | Edit | Warns about debug statements in edited files |
| test-file-reminder | Write | Reminds to write tests for new source files |

### Disabling Hooks

**Method 1: Environment variable (recommended)**

```bash
# Disable specific hooks (comma-separated hook names)
export DISABLED_HOOKS="block-no-verify,suggest-compact,doc-file-warning"
```

**Method 2: Override in ~/.claude/settings.json**

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write",
        "hooks": [],
        "description": "Override: disable all Write PreToolUse hooks"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Method 3:** Edit `hooks.json` directly after installing the plugin to remove or comment out specific hook entries.

## Component Details

### Skills

#### Git Workflow

**Covers:** Branching strategies (GitHub Flow, Trunk-Based, GitFlow), conventional commits, PR workflow, merge vs rebase, conflict resolution, release management, anti-patterns

**Activation keywords:** `git workflow`, `commit convention`, `branching strategy`, `merge conflict`, `PR description`

#### Lateral Thinking

**5 thinking personas** that diagnose your stagnation pattern and reframe the problem from a fresh angle:

| Persona | Core Question | Best For |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Contrarian | "What if the opposite were true?" | Challenging assumptions, inverting requirements |
| Hacker | "What constraints are actually real?" | Creative workarounds, prototype-first solutions |
| Simplifier | "What's the simplest thing that could work?" | Reducing complexity, removing unnecessary layers |
| Researcher | "What evidence do we actually have?" | Gathering facts, investigating root causes |
| Architect | "If we started over, would we build it this way?" | Structural problems, wrong decomposition |

**Activation keywords:** `stuck`, `blocked`, `can't figure out`, `lateral thinking`, `different perspective`, `unstuck`, `going in circles`

#### Consult Experts

**Provides access to 4 expert personas:**
- **Product Manager** - Product strategy, PRDs, user stories, success metrics
- **Tech Lead** - Technical requirements (TRDs), technical guidance, architecture decisions
- **System Design Specialist** - System architecture, SDDs, scalability, component design
- **Code Reviewer** - Code quality analysis, design decisions, system integration review

**Activation keywords:** `consult product`, `consult tech`, `expert advice`, `product strategy`, `code review expert`

### Agents

#### Documentation Architect
Comprehensive developer-focused documentation with context gathering, API docs, README files, data flow diagrams, and Maps of Content (MOC) navigation. Generates Hub, Domain, and Topic MOCs that explain *why* documents relate and suggest reading order for new developers.

#### Plan Reviewer
Architecture review, implementation plan analysis, risk assessment, best practices validation.

#### Refactor Planner
Refactoring strategies, tech debt analysis, SOLID violations detection, safe code restructuring. Includes brownfield-aware convention detection — scans for existing project conventions, config files, and established abstractions before recommending changes.

### Command Details

#### /code-review

Fast pre-commit quality gate. Checks security (CRITICAL), code quality (HIGH), and best practices (MEDIUM). Produces a severity report with verdict.

> For deep architectural reviews, use the consult-experts Code Reviewer persona.

#### /verify

Comprehensive codebase verification: build, type check, lint, tests, secret scan, debug statement audit, git status. Supports `quick`, `full`, `pre-commit`, and `pre-pr` modes.

#### /dev-docs-be

Generates a **per-phase** Technical Requirement Specification (TRS). Reads `/docs/2_architecture/TRD.md`, lists its Development Phases, asks you which phase to detail, then produces a flat task breakdown for that one phase — including component design, API specifications, database design, error handling, security considerations, and testing strategy. The command does NOT re-plan releases or phases; that's owned by the Product Manager and Tech Lead personas in the `consult-experts` skill.

**Output files** (in `dev/active/[feature-name]-phase-N/`):
- `[feature-name]-phase-N-plan.md` - Per-phase technical specification with flat task list
- `[feature-name]-phase-N-context.md` - Key files, decisions, dependencies
- `[feature-name]-phase-N-tasks.md` - Checklist for tracking progress

#### /dev-docs-update

Updates development documentation before context compaction for seamless continuation. Captures active task state, session context, and handoff notes.
