description: Use when the user wants to ingest, query, lint, check status, reduce, reflect, or reweave their personal knowledge base / second-brain wiki under docs/02_learning/. Trigger on phrases like "ingest into my wiki", "add this to my knowledge base", "absorb this paper", "update my wiki", "what does my wiki say about", "query my notes", "search my knowledge base", "wiki lint", "lint my wiki", "check my wiki for contradictions", "knowledge base status", "wiki status report", "file this into docs/02_learning", "add to second brain", "reduce this page", "extract atomic claims", "break this page down", "distill into atomic notes", "find connections in my wiki", "reflect on my wiki", "wiki connections", "what relates to X", "connect recent ingests", "reweave my wiki", "update old pages", "backward pass", "propagate recent ingests", "refresh stale pages", or any mention of raw/, wiki/, processed/, outputs/ inside docs/02_learning/. Also trigger when the user pastes an article, paper, or link and asks to "save", "absorb", "remember", or "keep" it alongside existing notes. The skill owns the three-layer raw/wiki/outputs architecture defined in docs/02_learning/README.md and performs ingest, query, lint, status, reduce, reflect, and reweave operations. Do NOT trigger for generic note-taking outside docs/02_learning/ or for the src/ productivity app.

# maintaining-wiki

## Purpose

This skill is the operating manual for a personal, LLM-maintained knowledge base living under `docs/02_learning/` in the `second-brain` repo. The user curates sources (drops articles and papers into `raw/`) and asks questions. The skill does everything else: reads sources, writes wiki pages, maintains cross-references, flags contradictions, and answers queries with citations.

The schema — frontmatter fields, `[[wiki-links]]`, `[Source:]` citations, contradiction markers, `index.md`, `log.md`, and the ingest/query/lint workflows — is defined in `docs/02_learning/README.md`. That file is the source of truth. **Read it on every invocation.** Do not restate its contents inside this skill.

Obsidian-compatible extensions (tags, aliases, callouts) are documented in `references/obsidian.md`. They are additive to the README schema; on first ingest after skill install, propose a README patch rather than silently diverging.

## How to read this skill

Progressive disclosure: this file tells you which operation to run and points to a reference file with the detail. Load only the reference you need.

| Operation | Reference file |
|---|---|
| ingest | `references/ingest.md` |
| query | `references/query.md` |
| lint | `references/lint.md` |
| status | `references/lint.md` (shares walk logic) + `references/templates.md` |
| reduce | `references/reduce.md` |
| reflect | `references/reflect.md` |
| reweave | `references/reweave.md` |
| Obsidian compat | `references/obsidian.md` |
| Prompt templates | `references/prompts.md` |
| File skeletons | `references/templates.md` |

Authoritative sources for rules:
- **Schema**: `docs/02_learning/README.md`
- **Obsidian extensions**: `references/obsidian.md`

If the README and a reference file disagree, the README wins, and you should propose a patch to bring them back into alignment.

## Operation selection

Pick the operation from user intent signals. If ambiguous, ask one clarifying question before proceeding.

| Signal from user | Operation |
|---|---|
| "ingest", "absorb", "file", "save", "remember", "add to wiki", pastes a link/path/content | **ingest** |
| "what does my wiki say", "according to my notes", "find in my notes", factual question in repo context | **query** |
| "lint", "audit", "check contradictions", "find orphans", "verify citations" | **lint** |
| "status", "what's in my wiki", "how many pages", "summarize my notes" | **status** |
| "reduce", "extract atomic claims", "break this page down", "distill", "this page is too broad" | **reduce** |
| "reflect", "find connections", "what relates to", "connect pages", "wiki connections", "link my pages" | **reflect** |
| "reweave", "update old pages", "backward pass", "propagate", "refresh stale pages" | **reweave** |

Rules:

1. **Multi-op requests** — if the user wants several operations in one turn (e.g. ingest then lint), run them sequentially and propose a single commit at the end.
2. **Fast exit** — if `docs/02_learning/` or `docs/02_learning/README.md` is missing, stop and surface the problem instead of improvising.
3. **Bootstrapping** — if `wiki/index.md` or `wiki/log.md` doesn't exist yet and the user asks for query/lint/status, create empty-but-valid versions from `references/templates.md` first and note that in the response.
4. **Ambiguity** — if intent is unclear, ask exactly one question and then proceed.

## Workflows (high-level)

Detail lives in the reference files. These summaries exist so you can route without loading the detail.

### ingest

**Precondition**: a file in `docs/02_learning/raw/` or user-pasted content that needs to be saved to `raw/` first (with `title`, `url`, `date`, and `ingested_via: paste | summary | atomic` in YAML — see `references/ingest.md` for the decision rule on which value to pick).

Steps:
1. Read the source and `docs/02_learning/README.md`.
2. Summarize *unless* `ingested_via` is `summary` or `atomic` (those skip this step — the raw file is already the digest). For `paste`: inline for single-source ingests; for batch ingests (>1 `paste` source in one turn), fan out one Task sub-agent per source and await all digests. See `references/prompts.md` and `references/ingest.md`.
3. Extract entities, concepts, metrics, systems from the digest (1–3 for `atomic` sources, 15–25 for papers).
4. Propose a touch plan sized to the source (~10 for papers, ~3–8 for summaries, 1–3 for atomic) **plus open-problem extraction** (top 3 by buildability, hard cap; atomic sources usually yield zero). Wait for user confirmation on both.
5. Apply: create/update pages using `references/templates.md`, every claim cited `[Source: filename.md]`. Append approved open-problem entries to `docs/00_ops/inbox/inbox.md` (vault-shape-aware; silent skip if absent).
6. Add backlinks from existing pages to new ones.
7. Update `wiki/index.md` (categorized) and append `wiki/log.md`.
8. Contradiction sweep; flag with `> [!warning] CONTRADICTION` callouts.
9. Surface `git status --short docs/02_learning/ docs/00_ops/inbox/inbox.md` and a proposed commit message. Do NOT commit.

Full walkthrough with worked examples: `references/ingest.md`.

### query

**Precondition**: `wiki/index.md` exists. If missing, run status first.

Steps:
1. Read `wiki/index.md`.
2. Pick candidate pages (title > tag > alias > slug > fulltext, ≤8 pages).
3. Read candidates.
4. Synthesize the answer; every factual sentence carries `[Source: page-name.md]`.
5. Offer to save to `outputs/YYYY-MM-DD_<slug>.md` using the output template.
6. Append `wiki/log.md` with the query.
7. If gaps surfaced, offer to file an ingest task.

Full detail: `references/query.md`.

### lint

Steps:
1. Walk `wiki/` via Glob/Read/Grep.
2. Run every check in `references/lint.md`.
3. Write `wiki/lint-report-YYYY-MM-DD.md` from the lint report template.
4. Append `wiki/log.md`.
5. Write `last_wiki_lint` and `last_wiki_lint_score` back to `docs/00_ops/meta/state.md` if present (vault-shape-aware; silent skip otherwise).
6. Propose fixes as a plan. Do not auto-apply.

Full checklist: `references/lint.md`.

### status

Read-only. No mutations, no log entry.

Steps:
1. Walk `raw/` and `wiki/`.
2. Count: raw files, wiki pages by status, orphan pages, last ingest date, days since last lint, pending `CONTRADICTION` callouts.
3. Read the last 10 entries of `wiki/log.md`.
4. Output the status report skeleton from `references/templates.md` — 5-bullet summary + counts.

Shares the walk logic with `lint`. Full checklist: `references/lint.md`.

### reduce

Breaks a broad wiki page into finer-grained atomic notes. Use after ingest when a page accumulates too many claims, or when lint flags an oversized page.

**Precondition**: a wiki page under `docs/02_learning/wiki/` (or an already-ingested raw source) that the user wants decomposed.

Steps:
1. Read the target page and its linked neighbors.
2. Extract claims into categories: core claims, patterns, tensions, enrichments, anti-patterns.
3. Apply composability tests (standalone sense, specificity, clean linking).
4. Duplicate detection against existing wiki pages.
5. Propose a split plan as a table. Wait for user confirmation.
6. Apply: create new atomic pages, update parent page (convert to MOC or trim), update enrichment targets.
7. Update `wiki/index.md` and append `wiki/log.md`.
8. Surface `git status` and proposed commit. Do NOT commit.

Full walkthrough: `references/reduce.md`.

### reflect

Discovers cross-connections between existing wiki pages to strengthen the knowledge graph. Supports targeted (single page) and sweep (recent ingests) modes.

**Precondition**: `wiki/index.md` exists with at least 2 pages.

Steps:
1. Identify target pages (user-specified or recent ingests since last reflect).
2. Build candidate pool via tag overlap, alias overlap, explicit mentions, category neighbors, keyword match.
3. Discover connections and classify: extends, contradicts, exemplifies, depends-on, complements.
4. Propose a connection plan as a table with link text. Wait for user confirmation.
5. Apply: insert `[[wiki-links]]` with context phrases, add reverse links for bidirectional connections.
6. Update `wiki/index.md` if cross-category references added, append `wiki/log.md`.
7. Surface `git status` and proposed commit. Do NOT commit.

Full walkthrough: `references/reflect.md`.

### reweave

Propagates new knowledge backward to older pages. The "backward pass" that makes the wiki compound in value rather than just accumulate.

**Precondition**: `wiki/log.md` has at least 2 ingest entries.

Steps:
1. Read `wiki/log.md` to identify the reweave window (ingests since last reweave, or last 5).
2. Extract key claims from recently ingested pages.
3. Find affected older pages via topic match, contradiction candidates, extension candidates, link traversal.
4. Classify each update: enrichment, contradiction, supersession, extension.
5. Propose an update plan as a table. Wait for user confirmation.
6. Apply: append claims, add CONTRADICTION callouts, annotate superseded claims. Bump `last_updated`.
7. Append `wiki/log.md`.
8. Surface `git status` and proposed commit. Do NOT commit.

Full walkthrough: `references/reweave.md`.

## Obsidian compatibility

Adopt these on every new wiki page so the directory can be dropped into an Obsidian vault later with zero rework:

1. `tags: []` in frontmatter (seed organically, no predefined taxonomy).
2. `aliases: []` for acronyms and synonyms.
3. Callouts: `> [!warning] CONTRADICTION`, `> [!note] Definition`, `> [!question] Open question`, `> [!info]` for source context. These render as plain blockquotes in non-Obsidian viewers — strictly additive.
4. Keep `[[wiki-links]]` and `[Source: file.md]` exactly as the README specifies.

Avoid: ` ```dataview ` blocks, `%% obsidian comments %%` (use HTML comments), Templater `<%` syntax, plugin-specific frontmatter keys.

These fields are not in `docs/02_learning/README.md` yet. On first ingest after skill install, propose a README patch adding an "Optional fields (Obsidian-compatible)" subsection and wait for user approval. Never mutate the README silently.

Full rationale: `references/obsidian.md`.

## Schema additions this skill assumes

Two conventions were added in v2.8.0 that a vault's `docs/02_learning/README.md`
may not document yet. On the first operation after upgrading, propose a README
patch for whichever is missing and wait for approval. **Never mutate the README
silently.**

### 1. `status: authored`

The status enum becomes `draft | authored | reviewed | needs_update`:

- **`draft`** — a genuine stub. Placeholder body, created to satisfy an inbound link.
- **`authored`** — the skill wrote the page in full from a source, but no human has
  reviewed it. **This is the ingest default.**
- **`reviewed`** — a human read it and signed off. Only a human can grant this.
- **`needs_update`** — known to be stale or superseded.

Why it exists: when `draft` doubled as "the skill made this," lint check #6 fired on
a template default that nothing ever cleared, reaching 49% of pages in a real vault
and rendering the check useless. See "Tuning the staleness check" in
`references/lint.md`.

Migrating an existing vault: pages the skill authored in full can be moved
`draft` → `authored` in bulk, since that asserts nothing about human review. Moving
anything to `reviewed` in bulk is never acceptable.

### 2. Negative citations

For recording that a source *doesn't* say something — an open question is often
load-bearing precisely because the source raised a claim without quantifying it:

```
[Source: filename.md — not stated]
[Source: filename.md — not quantified]
[Source: filename.md — not disclosed]
```

Rule: everything before the ` — ` must be a bare filename resolvable in `raw/`.
Writing the qualifier without the delimiter (`[Source: file.md doesn't quantify]`)
breaks citation resolution and will be reported by lint check #2b.

Multi-source citations use a comma list, all filenames resolvable:
`[Source: file-a.md, file-b.md]`. If one entry is a characterization rather than a
file, move it into the prose and cite only the file.

## Git integration

The skill never runs `git add`, `git commit`, or `git push` without explicit user confirmation.

After every mutating operation (ingest, lint with applied fixes, query that saves an output):

1. Run `git status --short docs/02_learning/` and show the diff summary.
2. Show a proposed commit message.
3. Show a staging command list the user can copy-paste.

Scope: stage files under `docs/02_learning/`. The ingest operation may also write to `docs/00_ops/inbox/inbox.md` (open-problem entries) and the lint operation may also write to `docs/00_ops/meta/state.md` (cadence + score); both are allowed but must be surfaced explicitly in the staging command. Never stage changes outside these three paths during a wiki operation.

Cadence: one commit per operation. Ingesting three sources = three commits.

Suggested commit message formats:

- `wiki(ingest): add <topic-slug> from <source-slug> [N pages touched]`
- `wiki(lint): apply lint fixes YYYY-MM-DD [severity]`
- `wiki(query): save answer on <topic> to outputs/`
- `wiki(reduce): extract N atomic claims from <parent-slug> [X new, Y enrichments]`
- `wiki(reflect): add N connections across M pages`
- `wiki(reweave): update N older pages with context from M recent ingests`

## Safety rules

The reasoning behind these rules: the wiki is a compounding artifact. A single silent overwrite or untracked deletion can erase context that took many sessions to build.

1. **Never modify files in `raw/`.** Sources are immutable. If a source is wrong, add a correction page in `wiki/` citing the discrepancy.
2. **Never delete wiki pages without explicit user confirmation.** Propose the deletion, show what links break, wait.
3. **Every mutation must be reflected in `wiki/log.md`.** No silent edits.
4. **Contradictions are flagged, never resolved silently.** Use the callout. Let the user decide which side wins.
5. **If a page's `source_count` would drop**, stop and ask. That usually means a citation was lost.
6. **Never promote query answers into wiki pages without user confirmation.** Queries can surface gaps, but filling them is an ingest operation.
