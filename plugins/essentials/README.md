        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Hooks not working?

**Check:**
1. Hook dependencies installed: `cd hooks && npm install`
2. Hooks are configured in `.claude/hooks/`
3. Node.js and npx available in PATH

**Test manually:**
```bash
echo '{"session_id":"test","prompt":"your test prompt"}' | \
  npx tsx hooks/skill-activation-prompt.ts
```

### Skills not activating?

**Check:**
1. Using trigger keywords in prompts
2. `skill-rules.json` exists in `.claude/skills/`
3. Keywords match your prompts

### Agents not working?

**Verify:**
1. Using correct agent names
2. Asking Claude to "Use the [agent-name] agent"
3. Agent files exist in `.claude/agents/`
